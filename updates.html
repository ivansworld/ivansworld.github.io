		<h2>9/20/2018 New Member</h2>
		<p> Today we have added a new member to the team, Tech. Tech will be helping out with the site as well as add his own <br>
		opinions and things like that. Hope you are fine with another member, and the nerd quiz is coming soon!!</p>
		<h2>9/8/2018 - Opinions + A Project</h2>
		<p>Today I have two big pieces of news to bring to you. The first one is that more content has been added<br>
		to the opinions page (yay!). The second thing is that a few friends and I currently have a huge project in the<br>
		works. I won't reveal too much until much later but it is a pen-and-paper RPG which has to do with politics,<br>
		adventuring, quests, and maps.</p>
		<h2>9/5/2018 - Updates Page</h2>
<p>For the purpose of making a user-accessable catalogue of all website updates, this page has been created. From now on, a
	<br>a description of every update will be provided as soon as possible after it has been made.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>8/29/2018 - Transport Tycoon Page</h2>
<p>A new (in progress) Open Transport Tycoon page has been added to the website. Eventually, it will feature game strategy/tips,<br>
		world downloads, mod reccomendations, and more.</p>
		<br>
  <h2>8/27/2018 - New Games Page</h2>
  <p>I have created a place-holder page for any games that will be eventually be added. Keep your eyes peeled for more.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>8/26/2018 - A new footer</h2>
  <p>After thinking about it for a little wile, I've decided to add a small ticker counter which shows the number of unique<br>
  visitors and that displays on every single page. I've also added a small "Ivan's World" button at the bottom of the page as<br>
  well. You can put this button anywhere on your own personal webpage (preferably linked) to show your affinity for this webpage.</p>
  <br>
	<h2>8/24/2018 - Welcome!</h2>
  <p>After three days of stumbling around with HTML and CSS, Ivan's World had finally been published! Even though there isn't<br>
  too much content on it as of now, more will be added as time goes on. So far, I have a few games in the works as well as<br>
  more ramblings, opinions, stories, and links. I also am considering whether I should add some more to the "about" page.</p>
