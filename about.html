	<h2>About Ivan</h2>
	<p>Greetings! You may know me by my real name or by my alias, Ivan Petrov. In fact, you likely don't know me at all. Either way,<br>
	welcome to my personal website! Some hobbies of mine include: Messing around with technology, Playing D&D, collecting vintage<br>
	calculators/computers, reading, writing, and ruining everything for everyone.
	<br>
	<h2>About Tech</h2>
	<p>Greetings! You may know me by my real name or by my alias, Tech. I am friends with Ivan, and I love D&D, Doctor Who, Harry Potter<br>
	and coding! I am really excited to get started working on this website, and making even more content for you to enjoy.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>What is the point of this website?</h2>
	<p>There isn't much of a "purpose" that this webpage serves. I guess that the main<br>
	reason for me creating it was so I could tell my buddies that I made a really awful<br>
	site with tons of unintentional "90s design" and poorly implemented CSS.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Ha, I can create a website that's a million times better than yours!</h2>
	<p>Then go ahead. You have nothing to prove to me. <i>I do not care.</i></p>
	<br>
	<h2>Your mommy isn't here, you can swear if you want, baby!</h2>
	<p>You can still get a point across without using profanities, and I decided to do that here<br>
	since I don't follow my own advice enough in real life.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>So, what can I do now, since I'm already here?</h2>
	<p>You could browse through a lot of text at "Ramblings", or you could take a brief<br>
	look at the "Opinions" page if you want to rile yourself up with alternate. viewpoints.<br>
	I also have some stuff that you can read for free, like my really bad D&D character<br>
	sheet and some poorly written 20,000 word "sci-fi" novella that I wrote quite a while ago.<br> 
	Just click on random hyperlinks until you get somewhere that's moderately interesting.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Some of the stuff on this site is offensive/stupid/uninformed/wrong/mean!!!</h2>
	<p>There's a very simple solution to this very pressing issue. Simply click on the<br>
	search bar, type in "www.tumblr.com", and complain to your heart's content!</p>
	<br>
	<h2>How could I get in touch with you to send a suggestions/comments?</h2>
	<p><td><font size="+1"><a href="contact.html">Just fill out this easy contct form.</a></font> Don't go filling my email with stupid shit.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Can I have editing privileges for this website?</h2>
	<p>Unless you...</p>
	<h3>Are Bill Gates himself</h3>
	<h3>Have the ability to turn water into wine</h3>
	<h3>Possess $10,000 that you can Pay-Pal to me</h3>
	<h3>Have stepped foot on the Moon</h3>
	<h3>Or can swallow and pass an entire box of nails without dying</h3>
	<h3>Are Tech </h3>
	<p>...then no, you can not have "editing privileges"</p>
	<p>And even if you do meet the criteria, I still likely won't give you editing<br>
	privileges (unless you actually do have $10,000 that you can Pay-Pal to me).</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Speaking of editing privileges... Here are my contributors</h2>
