<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<b>What is the point of this website?</b>
<br>Ivan's World does not aim to serve a single function. Rather, it is an experiment<br>
to see how closely I could reproduce the "90s web page" look on an entire website. Since<br>
then, I've transformed it into a personal website where I can upload all of my content to.
<br>
<br>
<b>Why am I here?</b>
<br>You either found one of "advertisements" somewhere in the city, came through a link<br>
on one of my other accounts, were referred here by me in real life, or were summoned by<br>
a wizard.
<br>
<br>
<b>This website looks terrible!</b>
<br>Then go ahead, make your own. You have nothing to prove to me. <i>I do not care.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Why "Ivan?"</b>
<br>Ivan was my old screen name on a popular chat client. When deciding on the website<br>
domain name, I wanted it to incorporate the alias, in case somebody was referred from<br>
the Ivan account.
<br>
<br>
<b>It wouldn't hurt to quit being so mysterious and use your real name.</b>
<br>I like separating my online life from the real world. Privacy is nice, especially<br>
in this day and age where everybody's trying to track you.
<br>
<br>
<b>What is there to do?</b>
<br>What is there not do do? A good place to start would be at the site Index. I'd<br>
suggest checking out my opinions page if you like reading differing viewpoints. There<br>
are also a few interesting downloads, such as a poorly written sci-fi novella which I<br>
made some time ago, on the personal page. Feel free to bookmark this website, as more<br>
content is bound to come in the future.
<br>
<br>
<b>Whoa, what happened to the old site?</b>
<br>I see that you noticed the recent change in theming, long-time user. Doesn't it look<br>
slightly better? I saved a copy of the old site to my computer, in case you're wondering.<br>
Still, it's not coming back.
<br>
<br>
<b>How could I go about contacting you?</b>
<br><a href="contact.html">Just fill out this easy contact form.</a> Please be nice to my email address...
<br>
<br>
<b>Could I write articles for this website as a contributor?</b>
<br>If I know you in real life, then sure. Just tell me that you want to contribute. I'd<br>
be more than happy to put your articles on my website. Speaking of contributors...
