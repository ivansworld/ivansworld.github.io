<h3>(In)Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<br>
<b>What is the point of this website?</b>
<br>Ivan's World does not aim to serve a single function. Rather, it is an experiment<br>
to see how closely I could reproduce the "90s web page" look on an entire website. Since<br>
then, I've transformed it into a personal website where I can upload all of my content to.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Why am I here?</b>
<br>You either found one of "advertisements" somewhere in the city, came through a link<br>
on one of my other accounts, were referred here by me in real life, or were summoned by<br>
a wizard.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>This website looks terrible!</b>
<br>Then go ahead, make your own. You have nothing to prove to me. <i>I do not care.</i>
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Why "Ivan?"</b>
<br>I've used the "Ivan" name as an alias for a little while and I wanted to use it.
<br>I got the name itself off of a list of popular Russian names since I usually use
<br>European names as aliases.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Where did you get all of the site backgrounds from?</b>
<br>All of the site backgrounds were sourced from archives of old OS wallpapers and floppy<br>
disk extras.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>What happened to [insert page, file, feature, etc. here]?</b>
<br>It was probably pruned and most likely won't be coming back. Sorry about that.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>What is there to do?</b>
<br>Click on the hyper-links and you'll find out!
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Whoa, what happened to the old site?</b>
<br>I see that you noticed the recent change in theming, long-time user. Doesn't it look<br>
slightly better? I saved a copy of the old site to my computer, in case you're wondering.<br>
Still, it's not coming back.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>You're wrong/stupid/mean/ugly/etc.</b>
<br>I suggest that you get off your computer and go to sleep. Getting mad behind a monitor<br>
isn't going to do anything.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Could I write articles for this website as a contributor?</b>
<br>If I know you in real life, then sure. Just tell me that you want to contribute. I'd<br>
be more than happy to put your articles on my website. Speaking of contributors...
