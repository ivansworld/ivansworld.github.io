<h1><b>Ivan's World</b></h1>
<h2>Have you ever wondered what pure, undisturbed HTML looks like?</h2>
<h3>This is it, this is a website in its purest form</h3>
<h4>And it is wonderful</h4>
<p>Experience the World Wide Web in its purest form, <i>right in front of your face.</i></p>
<br>
<p>Although it is 2019, there is still a place for these pure webpages.</p>
<p>Since this webpage is so tiny, it could fit on practically any device.</p>
<p>I bet that it could fit on my Databank Watch, or on my TI-58.</p>
<h3>So please, save the endangered HTML-only website</h3>
<h4>For only pennies a day, you can save a dying website near you.</h4>
<h5>Now, feel free to take in the entire experience. Your life will be changed.</h5>
<br>
<a href="index.html">End your pure bliss</a>
