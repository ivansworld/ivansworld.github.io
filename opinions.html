	<h2>Alright, here are a few opinions of mine.</h2> 
	<br>
	<h3>I have decided to rewrite all of the opinions to make them more "up to date." Enjoy.</h3>
	<h3>I also attempted to check the spelling a second time, so hopefully that was sucessful.</h3>
	<br>
	<p><b>Intelligence:</b> There is no such thing as an "unintelligent" person. Don't believe me? Think of something which you are<br>
	good at. It doesn't matter if it has to do with sports, gaming, socializing, singing, or skateboarding. Everybody is good at<br>
	something, even if they don't know it. Although traditionally intelligence has been viewed as academic, it can be found in many<br>
	other places as well. Although somebody such as a professor may be very academically intelligent, most wouldn't likely be able<br>
	to skateboard, even to save their own life. </p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Braces:</b> Semi-voluntary mouth torture in the form of overpriced metal glued to your teeth and then bound by wires.<br>
	As somebody who has them, I feel that braces aren't worth the pain. Just thinking of wires being tightened around and shifting<br>
	teeth is enough to make any sane person go numb</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Wireless Internet:</b> Being able to use the internet anywhere without having to use a bulky cable is very good. However, <br>
	if you use a stationary desktop computer and have a horrible internet connection, then using a wired connection is the better<br>
	option</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Nerd Culture/Labels:</b> One thing which I still do not understand is the fact that despite being an insult, the "nerd"<br>
	label has become more desirable as well as trendy in recent years. It almost seems as if "nerd culture" and "pop culture" have<br>
	intersected, making so-called "nerdy" traits become popular. These days, it's "cool" to like Science Fiction, Computers, and to<br>
	wear "nerdy" clothing. To be honest, I feel that the need to posess a label is more alarming than the people who beat up nerds<br>
	fifteen years ago taking on the identity. Your self-worth is determined by the impact which you leave on this world, not by<br>
	what your peers label you as. If you take away the connotation of said label, all that you get is a meaningless word. In<br>
	practice, the "coolest" of us are those who help others and who leave the world better whan it was beforehand. Although I may<br>
	not be "cool" as is defined by most, I still always attempt to leave people better off than they were before crossing my path.<br>
	"Jocks" aren't always idiotic, "Punks" aren't always violent, "Goths" aren't always depressed, "Nerds" aren't always smart, and<br> 
	"Hipsters" don't always ruin everything. 
	<br>
	<p><b>Laptop Trackpads:</b> Pretty much all of them are a chore to use. The trackpad's always not sensitive enough or<br>
	too sensitive, and when you glide your fingers over them, it either feels like you're touching a sticky pane of glass or<br>
	fine-grit sandpaper. To be honest, I greatly prefer IBM's trackpoint. Fore those who don't know, it's the red nub in the middle 
	of all thinkpad keyboards.</p>
	<img src="Files/Images/thinkpad.bmp" alt="gems" align="left">
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>&ensp; Ah... much better!<p>
	<br>
	<br>	
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p><b>State Standardized Testing:</b> I see it as a semi-viable way of measuring how well the students of a given school<br>
	are performing compared to state standards, but I dislike how the attitude with them is that if you get a bad score, then<br>
	you must be an idiot. You can know everything about a given subject and still score poorly on the test. There are so many<br>
	variables that is is impossible to tell one's true intellect from the results.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Social Media:</b> Data-mining and targeted advertisements forced onto your screen thinly disguised as a "trendy"<br>
	way to share blurry photos of yourself with your... lovely friends. It's been proven time and time again that social media<br>
	companies sell your personal data for a profit, so other companies can use it for promotional or more... shady purposes.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>DRM:</b> Just another way of software companies saying "Even though you bought our product, you don't actually<br>
	own it." If you buy a good, physical or software, then you have full ownership of said item. Besides, every single DRM<br>
	scheme ends up getting cracked within a few weeks and the software that you wrote ends up getting pirated anyways. Tip:<br>
	Loyal customers will always pay for your software, and pirates will always pirate. Absurd DRM measures hurt honest consumers<br>
	and do nothing to prevent piracy.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Smart Devices:</b> Not everything <b>has</b> to be a smart device to still be functional. Sure, Smart Watches, Smart TVs,<br>
	and smart speakers make sense. However, things begin to become over top when every manufacturer wants to release their own "smart"<br>
	thermostat, "smart" fan, "smart" car, and "smart" refridgerator
	<br>
	<p><b>Electric Vehicles:</b> Definitely the future, although as of now they're not worth buying compared to vehicles with<br>
	a traditional combustion engine due to their (usually) higher cost, long and inconvenient charging times, expensive as<br>
	hell batteries that are bound to fail way sooner than the motor, and the fact that every single electric car seems to have a<br>
	zillion screens and apps and LEDs that make it more similar to a computer on wheels than an actual car.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>PC RGB Lighting:</b> Can look pretty neat if done well. An example of well-done PC lighting would be a few RGB fans<br>
	and maybe another smaller component like the motherboard. Just don't make that much of your budget revolve around it.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>In-App Purchases:</b> A tell-tale sign of a low quality application or game. Instead of dealing with a barrage of ads and<br>
	having your wallet emptied so you can get more "gems," just spend the extra few bucks to buy software that doesn't have any of<br>
	that bull.</p>
	<img src="Files/Images/gems.bmp" alt="gems" align="left">
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>&ensp; Why the hell would somebody spend $4.99 on this worthless crap?<p>
	<br>
	<br>	
	<br>
	<br>
	<p><b>School:</b> Can be an interesting and even fun place if you go to a good one which also teaches subjects that you're<br>
	interested in. Otherwise, it's a complete and utter living hell. If you don't want to do anything other than flip hamburger<br>
	patties until you're old and gray, just stop wasting your time, your peer's time, and your teacher's time.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Sports:</b> Mostly a bunch of guys kicking/hitting/throwing/bouncing a ball around some sort of stadium. I've never<br>
	really gotten why people get so passionate while watching them but then again, I've never really cared about that sort of<br>
	thing anyways.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Cross-Country running:</b> I'm on the cross-country team and as somebody who isn't very good at anything to do with<br>
	physical activity, I'd describe it as "Horrible, excruciating pain while you're doing it but rewarding as eff in the end."</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Books:</b> <td><font size="+1"><a href="books.html">See my "decent enough" reading list</a></font></p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Politics:</b> Mostly pretty boring, to be honest. It's kind of absurd seeing tons of people from all sides of the argument<br>
	getting so passionate over the exact same things time and time again. Can't we all just quit fighting over silly purposely<br>
	dramatized scenarios designed to piss everybody off and work together to solve problems? Nevermind, politicians are amazing<br>
	people who could never tell a lie!</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>The News/Media:</b> Related to the topic above, it's all just more fake manufactured lies to make the unaware masses go<br>
	absolutely berzerk. Buzzfeed, CNN, Fox News, Infowars, it's all the same stuff, it's just paraphrased a thousand times over. If you<br>
	are in search of the actual truth, then try forming your own opinions from your own experiences for once.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Crowdfunding Sites: </b> I mean, somebody must have thought that it was a good idea to try to sell people an unfinished product<br>
	that doesn't even have a launch date yet considering that many people still keep falling into the same crowdfunding scams over and over<br>
	again. Seriously, hasn't anybody noticed any of the major examples of "Crowd Scamming" like the Batteriser and the overhyped "Solar <br>
	Freakin Roadways?"</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Patriotism: </b> I don't really have much of a problem with loving your country, until it turns into loving your country so much<br>
	that you feel superior to everybody else (Aka Nationalism). Also, Fourth of July BBQs are pretty nice to attend 'cause free food.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Toilet Paper: </b> I still have no clue why it's acceptable in this country today to wipe you behind with a thin piece of paper<br>
	instead of just using a bidet and maybe a few moist wipes? Plus, it's a massive waste of paper. If I got a nickle for the number of<br>
	times that I've seen a public restroom absolutely covered in toilet paper, then i'd have a very large number of said nickles.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Watches: </b> I've been wearing my Casio databank for a few years and I have to say, it's the best watch that I've ever owned.<br>
	It has lots of useful features like a calculator, a phonebook, dual time, etc. while still managing NOT to be a connected "smart"<br>
	device. Not only that, but I seem to get lots of people who don't know what it asking me why it has a keypad and complementing me.<br>
	I also owned a Pebble brand smartwatch for around half a year until I got so sick of having to charge the thing every other night and<br>
	connecting it to my phone just so it could quit nagging me about having no BlueTooth connection. Good riddance.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Desk fans: </b> A godsend for those who don't have a house AC unit, such as myself.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Calculators: </b> Another godsend, this time one for those who can't do/don't feel like making a calculation. Plus, vintage<br>
	models look pretty neat and can be pretty fun to fiddle with.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Obsolete hardware: </b> If you have a vintage piece of technology, offer to give it to somebody who might want it before you<br>
	get rid of it. Otherwise, nobody really wants your kicked-in Dell Windows Vista tower from 2008 that has a hard time running microsoft<br>
	paint because of all the bloatware.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Cryptocurrencies: </b> Everybody thought that Bitcoin was unstoppable, and then it crashed. Real money is way less volatile, and<br>
	the stock market is a better tried-and-true method of investing money to later make more than you invested. Also, all the stupid crypto<br>
	miners bought up every last effing graphics card during the Bitcoin craze and caused the prices for GPUs to be doubled. $1,000 for a<br>
	$500 card? No thanks.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Bird/Lime Scooters: </b> <font size="+1"><a href="no-more-birds.html">UGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!</a></font></p>
	<img src="Files/Images/scooter.bmp" alt="scooter" align="left">
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>&ensp; Some of the scooters at a "Bird's Nest." Even more obnoxious than vermin. <p>
	<br>
	<br>	
	<br>
	<br>
	<p><b>Cloud storage: </b> My data isn't yours to keep, thank you very much. I'd never trust Google drive with anything other than a school <br>
	book-report for any period of time. Long live physical storage mediums! You've heard of people hacking online cloud storage platforms, but<br> 
	have you ever heard of somebody hacking into a CD? I sure haven't</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Contributor's Column.</h2>
	<br>
	<p><b>Coding/Coders:</b> One ting I see a lot is people who do something on scratch or on code24 and consider themselves an <br>
	experienced coder. Now in no way do I consider myself top of the line, but you're reading this website so... we can obviously code <br>
	at least a little bit. If you go on scratch and make something YOU ARE NOT A CODER, unless of course you are, and are on there for fun, <br>
	but if you aren't, then actually take the time to lean how to code, it isn't that hard once you get the hang of it, and it's fun! -Tech</p>
