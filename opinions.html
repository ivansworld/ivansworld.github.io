<h3>Alright, here are a few opinions of mine.</h3>
<b>Designer Clothing:</b> A great deal of designer clothing is extremely ugly and overpriced (I'm looking at you, Gucci). The thought of paying $1500 for a pre-stained<br>
pair of oversized plaid pants that don't even go past the ankle is absurd. Hell, they were even trying to sell a plain white popplin shirt (that you could normally get at<br>
Ross for $10) for $750. If you have a lot of money to spend on clothing, go for quality and tried-and-true styles instead of buying the flashiest, loudest thing on the market.
<br><br>
<b>Reddit (new):</b> A decently-formatted site with a terrible, annoying community.
<br><br>
<b>AP Classes:</b> See the ramblings page.
<br><br>
<b>The Sims 4:</b> A fun, albeit overpriced, virtual dollhouse.
<br><br>
  <b>4chan:</b> The site is a cesspool of edgy internet racists, Japanese porn enthusiasts, and trolls. Enough said.
<br><br>
<b>Button down/up shirts:</b> I used to wear one every day but since they'd always puff out and get too hot, I swiched to polo shirts.
	<br><br>
  <b>Nuclear Fusion:</b> Fund fusion research! If we're going to quit using coal and gas power, wind turbines and solar panels alone can't support the entire country.<br>
The future will be powered by fusion and thorium, guarenteed. Don't be afraid of the atom.
	<br><br>
  <b>Math:</b> Don't get me wrong, math is a very important subject and <i>can</i> be interesting if taught properly. However, the way that it's taught in school makes it my least<br>
  favorite subject. Math can be fun, but being forced to do polynomial drills makes it quite the opposite.
<br><br>
  <b>Formal Clothing:</b> It's good to always dress and present yourself well. I wear formal clothing all the time because I like it. That's all that I can really say.
<br><br>
  <b>Github:</b> A great service which I use to host my site. The best part is that is costs <i>nothing</i>. That's right, absolutely nothing. Even if you don't have a website,<br>
  you can still push any programming project that you desire to your very own GitHub repo while also allowing others to collaborate with you. GitHub is great. Long live GitHub.<br>
  GitHub > PornHub.
	<br><br>
  <b>Programming:</b> With so many schools across the United States pushing coding upon students, all that I can really say is "Anyone can learn to code, but not everyone<br>
  <i>should</i> learn to code." If you enjoy it then go ahead, but don't learn it for the sake of landing a job that you'll end up hating. There are other equally useful skills<br>
  that you can learn and apply towards your career path.
<br><br>
  <b>Roman Numerals:</b> By far the prettiest numerical system. Why write 1987 when instead you could write MCMLXXXVII? As you may have seen, I am a pretty big fan of Roman<br>
  numerals and I try to use them as much as I can. With a little bit of practice, reading/writing Roman numerals practically becomes a second nature.
  <br><br>
  <b>Desk Fans:</b> Unfortunately, my house doesn't have an AC unit which makes bearing the hot LA summers rather difficult. Thankfully, desk fans (sort of) solve this<br>
  problem. Horse Badorties would be proud.
  <br><br>
  <b>Malls:</b> They're too crowded and loud for me. I get the convenience, but I'm still not a big fan.
  <br><br>
  <b>Movies:</b> Some of them are good, but many aren't. Movies were better back when CGI was in its infancy and not everything had to be overproduced.
  <br><br>
  <b>Digital Piracy:</b> All blockbuster game companies exploit people out of their money by making you pay $60 for a game, and then charging you $600+ for all of the<br>
  expansions (*cough* The Sims 4 *cough*). Although I am not advocating for piracy, it's insane how so many large companies would be fine with hurting their consumers<br>
  for nothing more than a minute increase of their bottom line. Anti-piracy advocates have been going on about how "if everybody pirated, then how would companies get<br>
  money?" However, there will never be a scenario where everybody becomes a pirate. Digital piracy is easier than ever, and yet the companies still make billions off of<br>
  their goods. There will always be genuine consumers, and there will always be pirates.
  <br><br>
	<b>Discord:</b> At its core Discord is a good IM platform. However, pretty much all of the public servers are full of 14 year-olds trying to seem "cool" and "edgy."<br>
	Along with that, around half of the people on there are racist and are not afraid to show it. This all adds up to create a rather... undesirable community.
  <br><br>
	<b>Anti-Vaxxers:</b> Stop fooling yourself and get vaccinated. The government is too busy wasting your tax dollars on useless programs to be putting poisonous<br>
	chemicals into vaccines, and what makes your small group of quack "scientists" more correct that a larger group of scientists who have time and time again, disproven<br>
	the untrue claims of vaccines causing autism. Your useless essential oils do absolutely nothing. Stop denying science and start being a logical human being.
	<br><br>
	<b>Speelign an gramer:</b> Speelign n gramer is dum! Actually though, quit constantly correcting people on how they spell words and follow grammar rules.<br>
	Misspelling words doesn't automatically make you stupid. In fact, I do it all the time. If people want your help, they'll ask. Also, for christ's sake stop<br>
	calling yourself a "Grammar Nazi." It sounds tacky.
	<br><br>
	<b>Music:</b> So many people are way to arrogant about music. Music taste is purely subjective. I bet that plenty of people hate what I listen to,<br>
	and I'm perfectly fine with that.
	<br><br>
	<b>Air Pods:</b> Another overpriced and overhyped Apple product. I realize that they are another status symbol, but are they really worth ~$150?<br>
	There are many cheaper options which offer a more superior level of quality, and yet you choose the Air Pods? Then again, I've never really been<br>
	a fan of wireless devices. Even though the non-ionizing radio waves may not <i>technically</i> damage DNA, they can't be too good for you in huge<br>
	amounts.
	<br><br>
	<b>Pre-Ripped Jeans:</b/> I've never been able to fathom why somebody would be alright with spending more money for a pair of pants which look<br>
	like they were torn during a drunken spree. Whereas a normal, whole pair of Levis 514 32X32 Mens jeans costs $39.99, the pre-torn pair costs an<br>
	astounding $49.99. If you really do enjoy wearing weathered jeans, you could save a bit of money by buying the whole pair and tearing them yourself,<br>
	or you could just wear them as is.
	<br><br>
	<b>Television:</b> It seems as if nobody really watches much television anymore. While I do catch PBS every once in a while, I don't watch it<br>
	otherwise. While TV used to be a way of life, now the internet has taken its place as the primary means of transmitting information,
	<br><br>
	<b>Modern Webpages:</b><a href="html.html">Bloated, not user friendly, and unoriginal.</a>
	<br><br>
	<b>The USA:</b> It's practically turned into an international circus. Case closed.
	<br><br>
	<b>Video Games:</b> I'll admit that I used to play a ton of them a long while ago. However, I don't so as much anymore. Video games these days<br>
	are expensive, bloated cash-grabs designed to siphon as much money from your bank account as they possibly can. The last video game that I bought<br>
	was a copy of some stupid christian clone of Wolfenstein 3D called "Super 3D Noah's Ark," and that was for $2.50 during the December Steam sale.<br>
	Everything else was... obtained through other means. The point is, I'm never going to pay for a modern AAA title. Support the indie devs instead<br>
	of putting more cash into the pockets of EA and T2.
	<br><br>
	<b>Books:</b> Books are pretty great, and they're definately more educational than banging your head against a keyboard as your webmaster<br>
	does. However, I still use my Fire HD 8 tablet over reading a book. Although it is from the evil privacy invader known as Amazon, I disabled<br>
	a bunch of their spyware and almost never have the internet connected. Another thing that makes it great is that I can put as many pirated ebooks<br>
	that I want into the thing and it will display them with bliss. Also, it only cost m e $50 during black Friday.
	<br><br>
	<b>Obsolete Computers:</b> Be nice to old computers, they can actually be worth quite a bit to collectors. Although your 2004 Pentium 4<br>
	Dell won't fetch any high bidders, a lot of old IBM, Apple, Commodore, etc. models from the 90s and older are worth something. There's<br>
	no point in recycling an old machine which you could easily sell to a collector who would appreciate it. Even if you can't sell it,<br>
	they are pretty fun to fiddle with.
	<br><br>
	<b>Fast Food:</b> Yes, it is bad for you. Yes, it tastes good. If I'm hungry after computer class and don't want to make something,<br>
	I couldn't care less about what's in the food or where it came from. It's advertised as being fast and cheap, not a gourmet vegan 100%<br>
	farm-to-table organic meal. It's one thing to eat a McDonalds burger once a week, and it's another to consume huge quantities of the stuff<br>
	every day for every meal. It's not McDonalds fault if your kids are morbidly obese from cramming down Happy Meals. How about you stop<br>
	buying them that every single day?
	<br><br>
	<b>Windows 10:</b> It's spyware, but at least I can run all of my Steam games and software. If it weren't for that, I'd still be<br>
	using Ubuntu.
	<br><br>
	<b>Windows 8:</b> An awful operating system which made everything more difficult. Thankfully nobody uses it anymore... or do they?
	<br><br>
	<b>Windows 7:</b> The second best version of Windows. It was slick, fast, and secure. Not to mention that it came with tons of<br>
	OEM PCs. It took Vista and made it not suck.
	<br><br>
	<b>Windows Vista:</b> Bloated and slow. The UI is nice but nobody asked for it. Thankfully it morphed into Windows 7.
	<br><br>
	<b>Windows XP:</b> The best version of Windows, by far. Even 16 or so years later, it has aged very well.
        <br><br>
	<b>Epic:</b> "Epic" is not epic. Epic.
	<br><br>
	<b>Reddit:</b> Although there are a ton of really bad subreddits (The_Donald, incels, LSC, etc.),there  are also quite a few good<br>
	ones. I've gotten a few free things from the guys over at r/retrocomputingbattlestations, and have had plenty of great laughs. Reddit<br>
	is the closest thing to social media that I'll touch. You should get a Reddit account. Long live Reddit.
	<br><br>
	<b>Web Advertisements:</b> I'd be fine with a little bit of web advertising if the advertisers didn't track you or take your data,<br>
	and if they weren't so obnoxious. Having a small 100x250 rectangle on the side of a website is one thing, and a giant autoplaying<br>
	which takes up the entire viewport and starts blasting audio at 100% is another. I personally use Adblock, and would recommend that<br>
	everybody starts using it until advertisers clean up their act.
	<br><br>
	<b>Cell Phones:</b> Cell phones used to be a phone in your pocket. Now, their anything but a phone. I bought a cell phone to keep<br>
	in contact with others, not so I could sip iBeer while sending blurry photos of my face to others and irradiating my brain.
	<br><br>
	<b>Firefox:</b> It's a pretty good browser. I prefer Opera but would still use it over everything else.
	<br><br>
	<b>Google Chrome:</b> It's a shame that Google Chrome turned out the way that it did. The chromium base is so great, yet Google<br>
	bogged it down with a crap ton of software designed to steal your information and sell it to advertisers. Use Opera. Opera is better.
	<br><br>
	<b>Opera Browser:</b> The best browser in the world, hands down. It's speedy yet light and includes features similar to chrome,<br>
	minus the datamining.
	<br><br>
	<b>YouTube:</b> There are a few channels which I watch regularly. However, most of the content on there seems to involve showing<br>
	off your money or getting into fake feuds. That, or some 10 year old screaming into a dollar store mic. Also, Google is an evil<br>
	company. YouTube should have never sold out to them.
	<br><br>
	<b>CDs/DVDs/Blueray:</b> What's the point of paying more for a physical copy of a song or movie which takes up tons of space<br>
	over purchasing it digitally? Although you keep telling yourself that the disks have resale value, you'll never actually end up<br>
	selling anything and they'll sit around forever. A hard drive can store tens of thousands of full HD movies in a tiny space.<br>
	Stop settling for less.
	<br><br>
	<b>Valentines Day:</b> Blatant commercialism. There's nothing romantic about a fake holiday created by companies to sell<br>
	more chocolate and flowers. Oh wait... that's every holiday. Not one has survived commercialism.
	<br><br>
	<b>Apple:</b> Apple is a terrible company. Their entire business model relies on cheating consumers out of large sums of money<br>
	for poorly made and inferior products. I can change the RAM on any other laptop, so why can't I do it on a Macbook? Oh wait,<br>
	you can't even replace the hard drive on their new computers. It seems as if 98% of their development goes into making the device<br>
	more difficult to get into, and the other 2% goes into making it fail faster.
	<br><br>
	<b>Intelligence:</b> It's difficult to find somebody who isn't "intelligent." Don't believe me? Think of something which you are<br>
	good at. It doesn't matter if it has to do with sports, gaming, socializing, singing, or skateboarding. Everybody is good at<br>
	something, even if they don't know it. Although traditionally intelligence has been viewed as academic, it can be found in many<br>
	other places as well. Although somebody such as a professor may be very academically intelligent, most wouldn't likely be able<br>
	to skateboard or sing or restore a car, even to save their own life.
	<br><br>
	<b>Braces:</b> Semi-voluntary mouth torture in the form of overpriced metal glued to your teeth and then bound by wires.<br>
	As somebody who has them, I feel that braces aren't worth the pain. Just thinking of wires being tightened around and shifting<br>
	teeth is enough to make any sane person go numb
	<br><br>
	<b>Wireless Internet:</b> Being able to use the internet anywhere without having to use a bulky cable is very good. However, <br>
	if you use a stationary desktop computer and have a horrible internet connection, then using a wired connection is the better<br>
	option
	<br><br>
	<b>Coding/Coders [TechMT]:</b> One thing which I see a lot is people who create something on scratch or on code24 and consider themselves an <br>
	experienced coder. Now, in no way do I consider myself top of the line, but you're reading this website so... we can obviously code <br>
	at least a little bit. If you go on scratch and make something YOU ARE NOT A CODER, unless of course you are, and are on there for fun, <br>
	but if you aren't, then actually take the time to lean how to code, it isn't that hard once you get the hang of it, and it's fun!
	<br><br>
	<b>Nerd Culture/Labels:</b> One thing which I still do not understand is the fact that despite being an insult, the "nerd"<br>
	label has become more desirable as well as trendy in recent years. It almost seems as if "nerd culture" and "pop culture" have<br>
	intersected, making so-called "nerdy" traits become popular. These days, it's "cool" to like Science Fiction, Computers, and to<br>
	wear "nerdy" clothing. To be honest, I feel that the need to possess a label is more alarming than the people who beat up nerds<br>
	fifteen years ago taking on the identity. Your self-worth is determined by the impact which you leave on this world, not by<br>
	what your peers label you as. If you take away the connotation of said label, all that you get is a meaningless word. In<br>
	practice, the "coolest" of us are those who help others and who leave the world better than it was beforehand.
	<br><br>
	<b>Laptop Trackpads:</b> Pretty much all of them are a chore to use. The trackpad's always not sensitive enough or<br>
	too sensitive, and when you glide your fingers over them, it either feels like you're touching a sticky pane of glass or<br>
	fine-grit sandpaper. To be honest, I greatly prefer IBM's trackpoint. Fore those who don't know, it's the red nub in the middle
	of all thinkpad keyboards.
	<br><br><br>
	<img src="Files/Images/thinkpad.bmp" alt="gems" align="left">
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>&ensp; Ah... much better!
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><br><br><br><br>
	<b>State Standardized Testing:</b> I see it as a semi-viable way of measuring how well the students of a given school<br>
	are performing compared to state standards, but I dislike how the attitude with them is that if you get a bad score, then<br>
	you must be an idiot. You can know everything about a given subject and still score poorly on the test. There are so many<br>
	variables that is is impossible to tell one's true intellect from the results.
	<br><br>
	<p><b>Social Media:</b> Data-mining and targeted advertisements forced onto your screen thinly disguised as a "trendy"<br>
	way to share blurry photos of yourself with your... lovely friends. It's been proven time and time again that social media<br>
	companies sell your personal data for a profit, so other companies can use it for promotional or more... shady purposes.
	<br><br>
	<b>DRM:</b> Just another way of software companies saying "Even though you bought our product, you don't actually<br>
	own it." If you buy a good, physical or software, then you have full ownership of said item. Besides, every single DRM<br>
	scheme ends up getting cracked within a few weeks and the software that you wrote ends up getting pirated anyways. Tip:<br>
	Loyal customers will always pay for your software, and pirates will always pirate. Absurd DRM measures hurt honest consumers<br>
	and do nothing to prevent piracy.
	<br><br>
	<b>Smart Devices:</b> Not everything <b>has</b> to be a smart device to still be functional. Sure, Smart Watches, Smart TVs,<br>
	and smart speakers make sense. However, things begin to become over top when every manufacturer wants to release their own "smart"<br>
	thermostat, "smart" fan, "smart" car, and "smart" refrigerator. Some things are better without tiny computers tacked onto them.<br>
	Along with that, these "smart" devices are more difficult to repair than their "dumb" counterparts. As soon as you add a touch<br>
	screen and wireless internet connectivity to something, you're instantly adding thousands of more parts which could go wrong.
	<br><br>
	<b>Electric Vehicles:</b> Electric cars are the future. However, as of now they're not worth buying compared to vehicles with<br>
	a traditional combustion engine due to their higher cost, long and inconvenient charging times, expensive eco-<i>unfriendly</i><br>
	batteries which are bound to fail before the motor does, and the fact that every single electric car seems to be going for a <br>
	"computer on wheels" theme.
	<br><br>
	<b>PC RGB Lighting:</b> Can look pretty neat if done well. An example of well-done PC lighting would be a few RGB fans<br>
	and maybe another smaller component like the motherboard. Just don't make that much of your budget revolve around it.
	<br><br>
	<b>In-App Purchases:</b> A tell-tale sign of a low quality application or game. Instead of dealing with a barrage of ads and<br>
	having your wallet emptied so you can get more "gems," just spend the few extra dollars to buy software that doesn't have any of<br>
	that malarkey.
		<br><br>
	<img src="Files/Images/gems.bmp" alt="gems" align="left">
	<br><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	&ensp; Why would somebody want to spend any real money on this
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	<p><b>School:</b> Honestly, I really do enjoy going to school. I am interested in the material, and going to school is<br>
	practically the only time that I ever leave the house. However, I've noticed that many others do not agree with my claim.<br>
	Although it may seem useless to be learning about angle proofs and mitosis, just the act of being in a classroom that you<br>
	couldn't care less about builds patience and resilience. Although you may not want to go to college, at least graduate from<br>
	high school.
	<br><br>
	<b>Sports:</b> A bunch of very tall or wide people kicking/hitting/throwing/bouncing a ball around some sort of stadium.
	I've never really gotten why people get so passionate while watching them but then again, I've never really cared about<br>
	that sort of thing anyways.
	<br><br>
	<b>Politics:</b> I find politics to be very boring. It's kind of absurd seeing tons of people from all sides of the argument<br>
	getting so passionate over the exact same things time and time again. Can't we all just quit fighting over silly purposely<br>
	dramatized scenarios designed to hit everybody's nerves and work together to solve problems? Nevermind, politicians are amazing<br>
	people who could never tell a lie!
	<br><br>
	<b>The News/Media:</b> Related to the topic above, it's all just more fake manufactured lies to make the unaware masses go<br>
	absolutely berserk. Buzzfeed, CNN, Fox News, Infowars, it's all the same stuff, it's just paraphrased a thousand times over. If you<br>
	are in search of the actual truth, then try forming your own opinions from your own experience.
	<br><br>
	<b>Watches: </b> I've been wearing my Casio databank for a few years and I have to say, it's the best watch that I've ever owned.<br>
	It has lots of useful features like a calculator, a phonebook, dual time, etc. while still managing NOT to be a connected "smart"<br>
	device. I used to own a Pebble brand smartwatch for around half a year. However, charging the watch every single night and dealing<br>
	with its poorly written software was a chore.
	<br><br>
	<b>Desk fans: </b> A godsend for those who don't have a house AC unit, such as myself.
	<br><br>
	<b>Calculators: </b> Another godsend, this time one for those who can't do/don't feel like making a calculation. If you haven't<br>
	heard, I collect calculators. A page with my collection on it is coming very soon!
	<br><br>
	<b>Cryptocurrencies: </b> Everybody thought that Bitcoin was unstoppable, and then it crashed. Real money is way less volatile, and<br>
	the stock market is a better tried-and-true method of investing money to later make more than you invested. Also, all those cryptominers<br>
	bought up every last video card during the Bitcoin craze and caused the prices for GPUs to be doubled.
	<br><br>
	<b>Bird/Lime Scooters: </b> <font size="+1"><a href="no-more-birds.html">NONONONONONONONONONO!</a></font>
	<img src="Files/Images/scooter.bmp" alt="scooter" align="right">
	<br><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	&ensp; Some of the scooters at a "Bird's Nest." Even more obnoxious than vermin. <p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	<b>Cloud storage: </b> My data isn't yours to keep, thank you very much. I'd never trust Google drive with anything other than a school <br>
	book-report for any period of time. Long live physical storage mediums! You've heard of people hacking online cloud storage platforms, but<br>
	have you ever heard of somebody hacking into a CD? I sure haven't
