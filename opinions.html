	<b>YouTube:</b> There are a few channels which I watch regularly. However, most of the content on there seems to involve showing<br>
	off your money or getting into fake feuds. That, or some 10 year old screaming into a dollar store mic. Also, Google is an evil<br>
	company. YouTube should have never sold out to them.
	<br><br>
	<b>CDs/DVDs/Blueray:</b> What's the point of paying more for a physical copy of a song or movie which takes up tons of space<br>
	over purchasing it into making it fail faster. 
	<br><br>
	<b>Intelligence:</b> It's difficult to find somebody who isn't "intelligent." Don't believe me? Think of something which you are<br>
	good at. It doesn't matter if it has to do with spor<h3>THIS WEBSITE HAS BEEN BOUGHT BY LLAMASWORLD.ME!</h3>

. Although traditionally intelligence has been viewed as academic, it can be found in many<br>
	other places as well. Although somebody 're reading this website so... we can obviously code <br>
	at least a little bit. If you go on scratch and make something YOU ARE NOT A CODER, unless of course you are, and are on there for fun, <br>
