<h2>Welcome to Ivan's World, the personal domain of Ivan Petrov.</h2>

<h3>This is it, this is a website in its purest form</h3>
<h4>And it is wonderful</h4>
<br>
I get that everybody wants their site to stand out and be flashy, but there's a certain<br>
point where all of the "modern-design" becomes boring and overused. I may be a terrible<br>
web designer, but it doesn't take much thought to realize that every single generic<br>
millennial blog's design is boring, bloated, and overall unnecessary. This page is an<br>
obvious exaggeration and while I don't think that McDonalds should be modeling their<br>
corporate site after mine, it can't hurt to put function over form. Hampering websites<br>
from performing property or being compatible with legacy devices in the name of vanity<br>
isn't progress, it's regression. I tried out my site on IE 5 and unsurprisingly, it loads<br>
perfectly. The Internet was meant to unify humanity and instead, it is bringing us further<br>
apart.
