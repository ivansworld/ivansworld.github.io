			<h2>They were dumped onto the streets Los Angeles without any further notice, and now they're absolutely everywhere. This is not<br>
			an invasion from another country or another planet. No, this is an Invasion of the Scooters.</h2>
			<p>LA has always had awful traffic and pollution issues. Hell, the highway is so crammed during rush hour that if you got out of<br>
			your car, walked two miles to the local cafe for some food and walked back, the traffic still wouldn't have moved an inch.<br>
			Then in September 2017, a new startup called "Bird" released what they thought would be the solution to LA's increasing traffic<br>
			and pollution problem; release a ton of electric scooters that you pay per mile to ride onto the streets. There have already<br>
			been public pay-per-mile bikes for quite some time. However, the key difference between the bicycles and the bird scooters is that<br>
			the scooters are "dockless," meaning that instead of returning them to a designated dock when you're done riding you just leave<br>
			them lying wherever you feel like. They're all over the sidewalks, the streets, the beach, and pretty much any other place in LA<br>
			that has some room to ride in.</p>
			<br>
				<img src="Files/Images/iTard.bmp" alt="board" align="left">
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>&ensp; This is now an extremely common sight all over LA county.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>They're a major safety hazard.</h2>
			<p>According to both the Bird Scooter App, each rider must be over 18, have a valid driver's license, and wear a helmet. Want to<br>
			know how many Bird riders that I've seen wearing helmets? Maybe one or two. Not only that, but I've seen numerous kids that don't<br>
			like they're 18 or that they even have a drivers license going zipping down the sidewalk at 15 miles per hour. Just while walking<br>
			I've almost been hit by a speeding scooter on the sidewalk at least eight, maybe nine times. No helmet + underage + riding alongside<br>
			pedestrians/cars = disaster. And yet, the Bird company doesn't seem to care to much regarding the problem. It'll take a horrific, gruesome<br>
			accident involving a bunch of brutally destroyed Bird riders/pedestrians/motorists for something to be done.</p>
			<br>
				<img src="Files/Images/shit.bmp" alt="board" align="left">
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>&ensp; I swear, somebody's bound to get fatally injured on or by one of those scooters</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>The scooter virus won't stop spreading anywhere and everywhere</h2>
			<p>Over the course of it's existence, the Bird company has released it's virus onto 41 unsuspecting cities in three different countries.<br>
			Meanwhile, it's competitor Lime has unleashed even more of the scooter infection onto 81 cities in four countries. Before the scooter<br>
			pandemic, I was used to see tons and tons of trash littering the streets. These days, I still see litter all over the place, except now<br>
			a good portion of it is in the form of half-destroyed public scooters.</p>
			<br>
			<img src="Files/Images/lime.bmp" alt="board" align="left">
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>&ensp; Both Bird and Lime are to blame for the scooter outbreak.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>If you abandon your car in the middle of the street, it'll get towed away and you'll likely be fined or arrested. If you leave a Bird<br>
			scooter in the middle of the street, some hipster will hop on within minutes and zip off to "Ye Olde' Bearded Oil Shoppe." Birds and Limes<br>
			need to be banned until they can sort everything out and/or have clear regulations to abide by.</h2>

			<p>&ensp; I hope that in the years to come, only this kind of bird scooter will be left.</p>
