<h3>Study Materials [Ivan - March 19th, 2019]</h3>
Here's a small announcement. Check on the Academics page, as I have added links to my quizlet classrooms for English and History.<br>
While my specialty is still making science study guides, I have also decided to share some sets that I've already made to help you,<br>
the people. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>More Quizzes [Ivan - March 4th, 2019]</h3>
Well, a lot got done today. I've added two new tests for your enjoyment; a slimmer version of the Nerd Test and a new Old<br>
Person test. Both are only 100 questions, so it can't hurt to give them a try. Also, be sure to take the 350 question Official<br>
Nerd Test. All can be found on the Personal page.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The Internet of Things [Ivan - March 1st, 2019]</h3>
I finally made a webcomic. Although I didn't spend any time on making pretty art, I do think that the message is conveyed<br>
well enough. I plan on releasing more editions of The Internet of Things comic in the future. Remember, send all ideas over<br>
to the about>contact page. If you want to read the comic, just go to Ramblings.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>More to Read! [Ivan - Feb 25th, 2019]</h3>
<img src="Files/Images/666.PNG" alt="board" align="right">
Over the past few days, you may have noticed two things; that the view counter now looks different and that there is a<br>
lot more to read on the site. Yes, I have added a few more opinions and have posted another story to the Personal > Writing<br>
page. Also, the old counter actually quit working. It flat-out refused to do anything. I ended up upgrading the counter so<br>
it shows the total page views (not unique) for each individual page. Also, it looks much prettier than the old one.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The Nerd Test [Ivan - Feb 25th, 2019]</h3>
The Official Nerd Test is finally finished, after all these months! The test itself is 350 questions long, and it ranks you<br>
based on the percentage of the questions that you're ticked. A higher percentage means that you have a higher nerd-factor.<br>
The test is still in the beta testing stage, so feel free to send me suggestions 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Ivan's Domain [Ivan - Feb 17th, 2019]</h3>
I was finally able to obtain a real web address for the website. Although it isn't as great as "ivansworld.net,"<br>
"ivansworld.me" is still better than "ivansworld.github.io." As was posted on the index page, the old url still<br>
works and you should still keep it bookmarked. It isn't going anywhere, as long as this site is hosted on Github.<br>
I'd still reccomend at least knowing the ".github.io" address incase the ".me" one ever goes down, though. However,<br>
it will be much easier to remember the url and tell it to others. 
<br>

<h3>Trains and Study Guides [Ivan - Feb 17th, 2019]</h3>
Quite a bit of work has been going on today. I added my old Transport Tycoon Page to the personal tab,<br>
made a lot of headway on the Nerd quiz, and added a few more improvements all around. I would also like<br>
to steer your attention to the Academics page, where there is a biology <b>chapter 4 study guide.</b> It<br>
features 11 entire pages packed to the brim with information, so I suggest that you download and print it<br>
out. After all, it can't hurt to have notes from the entire chapter. More is coming later today, so keep<br>
that in mind.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Content Galore [Ivan - Feb 11th, 2019]</h3>
It's only been a day since the new website launched and already, I've added a ton of new content. Mostly<br>
new opinions and games. In the next few days more will be added, so remember to check back frequently.<br>
Everything is still undergoing testing, so don't be afraid to send me any suggestions or bug reports using<br>
the contact form on the "About Me" page.

<h3>Long Life the New Website! [Ivan - Feb 10th, 2019]</h3>
The old website is gone, forever. I'm not bringing it back. However, there is a much nicer and<br>
more intuitive site on the block. Long live Ivan's World 2.0! Now instead of looking like something<br>
that a drunk kid make in 1996, the site now resembles that of a company which hasn't existed or<br>
updated anything since the year 2002. How wonderful.
