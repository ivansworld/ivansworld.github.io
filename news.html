<h3>Ivan's Domain [Ivan - Feb 17th, 2019]</h3>
I was finally able to obtain a real web address for the website. Although it isn't as great as "ivansworld.net,"<br>
"ivansworld.me" is still better than "ivansworld.github.io." As was posted on the index page, the old url still<br>
works and you should still keep it bookmarked. It isn't going anywhere, as long as this site is hosted on Github.<br>
I'd still reccomend at least knowing the ".github.io" address incase the ".me" one ever goes down, though. However,<br>
it will be much easier to remember the url and tell it to others.

<h3>Trains and Study Guides [Ivan - Feb 17th, 2019]</h3>
Quite a bit of work has been going on today. I added my old Transport Tycoon Page to the personal tab,<br>
made a lot of headway on the Nerd quiz, and added a few more improvements all around. I would also like<br>
to steer your attention to the Academics page, where there is a biology <b>chapter 4 study guide.</b> It<br>
features 11 entire pages packed to the brim with information, so I suggest that you download and print it<br>
out. After all, it can't hurt to have notes from the entire chapter. More is coming later today, so keep<br>
that in mind.

<h3>Content Galore [Ivan - Feb 11th, 2019]</h3>
It's only been a day since the new website launched and already, I've added a ton of new content. Mostly<br>
new opinions and games. In the next few days more will be added, so remember to check back frequently.<br>
Everything is still undergoing testing, so don't be afraid to send me any suggestions or bug reports using<br>
the contact form on the "About Me" page.

<h3>Long Life the New Website! [Ivan - Feb 10th, 2019]</h3>
The old website is gone, forever. I'm not bringing it back. However, there is a much nicer and<br>
more intuitive site on the block. Long live Ivan's World 2.0! Now instead of looking like something<br>
that a drunk kid make in 1996, the site now resembles that of a company which hasn't existed or<br>
updated anything since the year 2002. How wonderful.
