			<b>Long Live the New Website... II! [Ivan - June 7th, 2020]</b><br>
			What happens when a nerd who has a personal webpage and knows rudimentary HTML/CSS gets really, really bored?<br>
			Why, he revamps his site, of course. Yes, I've done it again; I've overhauled my (dying) website yet again.<br>
			I've graduated beyond 64x64 bitmap tiles (not really) and clunky analytic counters (RIP old counter) to create<br>
			what is, quite possibly, the least awful iteration of Ivan's World. Go ahead, gander at all of the orange jpeg<br>
			background and textured menu-bar goodness, and then promptly realize that I could make something 1000x better<br>
			looking with Wordpress or Weebly. Oh well, that's not very fun. :-P
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Nerd Test II [Ivan - November 3rd, 2019]</b><br>
			I finally took your advice and remade the Nerd Test. Go down to the personal page and take it!
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Untitled News Entry [Ivan - September 11th, 2019]</b><br>
			I did a bit of work on the website today. Just a bit of maintainence, and some visual changes. I changed the background and favicon<br>
			(if you can't see it, clear your browser's cache). Anyways, I'm planning on making some new fun things (such as quizzes). And remember,<br>
			if you have any suggestions please email me at galacticivanpetrov@gmail.com. Have a good day!
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>I'm still alive. [Ivan - August 18th, 2019]</b><br>
			Although I haven't made too many edits during the summer, I am alive and well. You should expect to see more content when school is<br>
			back!
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>THE 1ST HISTORY FINAL STUDY GUIDE HAS BEEN RELEASED! [Ivan - June 2nd, 2019]</b><br>
			IT'S FINALLY HERE, THE STUDY GUIDE FOR ROME AND CHRISTIANITY! It's 15 pages long and very text heavy. For ease of use, I've bolded<br>
			important topics that WILL BE ON THE FINAL. Part 2 is coming soon, so keep your eyes peeled!
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>The Chapter 6 Study Guide [Ivan - May 7th, 2019]</b><br>
			Yesterday (and technically today) I worked from approximately 5:00pm - 12:30am just so I could bring you guys the study guide. This<br>
			time around it features 12 pages chock-full of text and images covering the entire meiosis/genetics/blood unit. If you are interested,<br>
			just hop onto the Academics page and study to your heart's content. As a side note, I highly suggest that you go back and write your own<br>
			notes to use on the exam. The study guide's purpose is to enhance, not replace, your own notes.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>How to get an A on your Bio Exam [Ivan - March 23rd, 2019]</b><br>
			It's finally complete; the study guide for Dr. Llamas Honors Biology class. Go down to the Academics page and download it. In other<br>
			news, I also changed the website theme to a space theme while also adding a lot of new content to the about page. I have also been<br>
			working on a new project which I think that you all will enjoy.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Study Materials [Ivan - March 19th, 2019]</b><br>
			Here's a small announcement. Check on the Academics page, as I have added links to my quizlet classrooms for English and History.<br>
			While my specialty is still making science study guides, I have also decided to share some sets that I've already made to help you,<br>
			the people. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>More Quizzes [Ivan - March 4th, 2019]</b><br>
			Well, a lot got done today. I've added two new tests for your enjoyment; a slimmer version of the Nerd Test and a new Old<br>
			Person test. Both are only 100 questions, so it can't hurt to give them a try. Also, be sure to take the 350 question Official<br>
			Nerd Test. All can be found on the Personal page.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>The Internet of Things [Ivan - March 1st, 2019]</b><br>
			I finally made a webcomic. Although I didn't spend any time on making pretty art, I do think that the message is conveyed<br>
			well enough. I plan on releasing more editions of The Internet of Things comic in the future. Remember, send all ideas over<br>
			to the about>contact page. If you want to read the comic, just go to Ramblings.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>More to Read! [Ivan - Feb 25th, 2019]</b><br>
			<img src="Files/Images/666.PNG" alt="board" align="right">
			Over the past few days, you may have noticed two things; that the view counter now looks different and that there is a<br>
			lot more to read on the site. Yes, I have added a few more opinions and have posted another story to the Personal > Writing<br>
			page. Also, the old counter actually quit working. It flat-out refused to do anything. I ended up upgrading the counter so<br>
			it shows the total page views (not unique) for each individual page. Also, it looks much prettier than the old one.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>The Nerd Test [Ivan - Feb 25th, 2019]</b><br>
			The Official Nerd Test is finally finished, after all these months! The test itself is 350 questions long, and it ranks you<br>
			based on the percentage of the questions that you're ticked. A higher percentage means that you have a higher nerd-factor.<br>
			The test is still in the beta testing stage, so feel free to send me suggestions 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Ivan's Domain [Ivan - Feb 17th, 2019]</b><br>
			I was finally able to obtain a real web address for the website. Although it isn't as great as "ivansworld.net,"<br>
			"ivansworld.me" is still better than "ivansworld.github.io." As was posted on the index page, the old url still<br>
			works and you should still keep it bookmarked. It isn't going anywhere, as long as this site is hosted on Github.<br>
			I'd still reccomend at least knowing the ".github.io" address incase the ".me" one ever goes down, though. However,<br>
			it will be much easier to remember the url and tell it to others. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>

			<b>Trains and Study Guides [Ivan - Feb 17th, 2019]</b><br>
			Quite a bit of work has been going on today. I added my old Transport Tycoon Page to the personal tab,<br>
			made a lot of headway on the Nerd quiz, and added a few more improvements all around. I would also like<br>
			to steer your attention to the Academics page, where there is a biology <b>chapter 4 study guide.</b> It<br>
			features 11 entire pages packed to the brim with information, so I suggest that you download and print it<br>
			out. After all, it can't hurt to have notes from the entire chapter. More is coming later today, so keep<br>
			that in mind.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Content Galore [Ivan - Feb 11th, 2019]</b><br>
			It's only been a day since the new website launched and already, I've added a ton of new content. Mostly<br>
			new opinions and games. In the next few days more will be added, so remember to check back frequently.<br>
			Everything is still undergoing testing, so don't be afraid to send me any suggestions or bug reports using<br>
			the contact form on the "About Me" page.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>

			<b>Long Live the New Website! [Ivan - Feb 10th, 2019]</b><br>
			The old website is gone, forever. I'm not bringing it back. However, there is a much nicer and<br>
			more intuitive site on the block. Long live Ivan's World 2.0! Now instead of looking like something<br>
			that a drunk kid make in 1996, the site now resembles that of a company which hasn't existed or<br>
			updated anything since the year 2002. How wonderful.
