				<b>Why you should download OpenTTD</b>
			<p>I've only really been playing OpenTTD on and off for about a year, but it's still managed to be one of my favorite games. In a world<br>
			full of EAs and Bethesdas looking to drain every last dollar from your bank account, OpenTTD doesn't need to charge you for anything.<br>
			Along with that, it's actually a really great game for those who enjoy business, trains, thinking logically, making money, and more. Once<br>
			you've gotten sick of the included vehicles, landscape, industries, music, etc. you can also download a colossal number of mods from the<br>
			built in mod loader.</p>
			<img src="Files/Images/trains.png" alt="board" align="right">
			<br>
			<b>How to play:</b>
				<p>Unlike pretty much every single unnecessarily violent and profane game made today, Transport Tycoon provides clean, intelligent,<br>
				and family-friendly game play. The goal of the game is to run a successful transport company from 1950 to 2050. You gain more money by<br>
				building logically-placed bus/truck stops, train lines, ship docks, and airports. You can then purchase a wide range of vehicles using<br>
				your company's capital and begin moving passengers or cargo from place to place. Sounds simple enough, right?</p>
				<br>
				<b>Well, it isn't that simple</b>
				<p>You still must manage your funds at the same time as you attempt to build more infrastructure and as you build more, your expenses<br>
				rise. At the same time the train mechanics can be confusing to new players, and the game has a semi-steep learning curve. Still, all of these<br>
				factors contribute to making Open TTD very popular among all those whom enjoy a good challenge. Unlike the slew of uninspired and over hyped<br>
				money-vacuums that are released today, Open TTD encourages critical thinking and problem solving.</p>
				<br>
				<b>"Can I run it on a (insert system here)?"</b>
				<p>Since Open TTD is both very popular and open source, it has been ported to virtually every semi-modern operating system and CPU architecture.<br>
				You can even play it in your browser, if that's your sort of thing (see my links page). Not only that, but Open TTD also runs pretty well since it<br>
				lacks any 3D graphics.</p>
