 	<h2>In a world full of micro-transaction filled "Blockbuster" game titles competing to have the best graphics and to siphon the most money from<br>
  	you wallet, Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe is an opensource port of Tom Sawyer's Transport Tycoon Deluxe. Oh, and it's free.</h2>
 	<p>I've only really been playing OpenTTD on and off for about a year, but it's still managed to be one of my favorite games. In a world<br>
  	full of EAs and Bethesdas looking to drain every last dollar from your bank account, OpenTTD doesn't need to charge you for anything.<br>
  	Along with that, it's acutally a really great game for those who enjoy business, trains, thinking logically, making money, and more. Once<br>
  	you've gotten sick of the included trains, landscape, industries, music, etc. you can also download a colossal number of mods from the<br>
  	built in mod downloader.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>How to play:</h2>
		<p>Unlike pretty much every single unneccesarly violent and profane game made today, Transport Tycoon provides clean, intelligent,<br>
		and family-friendly gameplay. The goal of the game is to run a successful transport company from 1950 to 2050. You gain more money by<br>
		building logically-placed bus/truck stops, train lines, ship docks, and airports. You can then purchase a wide range of vehicles using<br>
		your company's capital and begin moving passangers or carge from place to place. Sounds simple enough, right?</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Well, it isn't that simple</h2>
		<p>You still must manage your funds at the same time as you attempt to build more infastructure and as you build more, your expenses<br>
		rise. At the same time the train mechanics can be confusing to new players, and the game has a mild learning curve. Still, all of these<br>
		factors contribute to making Open TTD very popular among all those whom enjoy business, logic, logistics, transportation and a good<br>
		challenge. Unlike the slew of uninspired and overhyped money-vacuums that are released today, Open TTD encourages critical thinking and<br>
		problem solving.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>"Can I run it on a (insert system here)?"</h2>
		<p>Since Open TTD is both very popular and opensource, it has been ported to virtually every semi-modern operating system and CPU architecture.<br>
		You can even play it in your browser, if that's your sort of thing (see my links page). Not only that, but Open TTD also runs pretty well on most<br>
		systems, since it has simplistic isometric graphics and due to this, does not use a 3D engine.</p>
