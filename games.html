<p>Genesis 2 - A New Beginning
The button at the far left corner with the music notes is "mute." Use it to mute or unmute the in-game audio<br>
Next to it is a button that has a yellow arrow pointing to a tile. This is the "load" button, used to load save game codes!<br>
Next, we have the "save" button that's labeled with a floppy disk.This button spits out a save game code so others can view your world!<br>
After that is a button with a pretty looking landscape on it. That button is the one which opens the item menu. We'll be using it later!<br>
Then there is the button with a bar graph on it. Click that, and you'll see the total amount of blocks placed as of 5:30 PM PST 1/20/2018 <br>
Next is the button labeled with a sign. Click that and you'll see the in-game help menu.<br>
Second to last is the clear button which clears the landscape!<br>
The last button, with the question mark, shows info about the game's development. Pretty much an in-game version of the "Notes and Credits."<br>
On the right corner of the screen, there is a long bar covered in six tiles. This "item-bar" stores recently clicked and used items automatically!<br>
<br>
Upon clicking the "item menu" button you are greeted with a green window that says "Construction" at the top and has tons of tiles all over the place. <br>
To select an item that you want to use, simply click any tile. It should move into the item-bar automatically. This tileset is good and all but what about <br>
building cities and roads? On the right-hand corner of the window, there are three buttons. Click the one with the trees for ground/nature tiles, click the <br>
one with the buildings for, well, buildings and finally, click the one with the road on it for roads. Once you're done you can either click the landscape <br>
button again or the "X" on the window to exit out.<br>
<br>
Now that we've selected our tiles, click on the desired tile located in the item-bar. After that, all you have to do is click and drag the mouse around.<br> 
<br>
If you want to continue working on a world at a later date or share it with friends, you can save the world. To do that click on the button labeled with the <br>
floppy disk. A giant list should pop up, containing a code. This is your world code. Double click on the orange part of the list and press "Control C" (Command <br>
C on a mac) to copy the text. Afterwards, you can paste it into the comments or anywhere else.<br>
To close the list just click the "save" button again.<br>
<br>
Loading couldn't be easier. Once you've got a code copied into the clipboard, click the button containing the two orange arrows. After that, paste the code <br>
into the text field and hit enter. After a few seconds, the world should be fully loaded.<br>
