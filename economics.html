			<br>
			<b>'Murican Capitalism</b><br>
			You wake up in the morning to the national anthem. You get in your Ford Raptor truck and drive to your<br>
			ranch, where you spend the long day wrangling cattle. You get back home and eat a large meal of mashed potatoes<br>
			and steak. You have a heart attack. You can't afford to go to a hospital and die.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Anarcho-Capitalism</b><br>
			You wake up to an ad for Wendys™ recreational nuclear warheads. You get in your tank and drive to the<br>
			McDonalds™ Mega corp headquarters. You get accused of committing McTreason™ for Carls Jr.™ by stealing McProperty™.<br>
			by doing so, you are violating the non-aggression principle. A McNuclear™ McAirstrike™ is deployed on your house.<br>
			McDonalds™ McAnnexes™ your land.
			<br><br>
			<b>Capitalism</b><br>
			You wake up in your apartment to screech of your alarm. You drive your falling-apart 1993 Toyota to your dead-end job.<br>
			You toil away for hours for little pay. You get home and eat a sub par microwaved dinner. You contemplate your existence.
			<br><br>
			<b>Canadian-ism</b><br>
			You wake up to the refreshing sound of Niagara Falls. You get on your horse and ride to the forest where you gather maple<br>
			syrup. Before you can get to Tim Hortons for dinner, you feel a sharp pain in your abdomen. You drive to the hospital and<br>
			the doctor orders a CT scan. However, you are placed onto a wait list. You die from colon cancer after waiting over a year,<br>
			never getting your scan.
			<br><br>
			<b>European-ism</b><br>
			You wake up to a folk-song, get in your Volkswagen Golf, and drive to work at the local restaurant. You eat a giant steak.<br>
			You get Mad-Cow disease and die. The USA bans beef from your country, and there is universal mass hysteria.<br>
			<br><br>
			<b>Marxism</b><br>
			You wake up to the sound of your comrades toiling away. You walk down to the commune farm and spend the day harvesting crops<br>
			and feeding animals. For dinner, everybody takes as much as they want. Fat Alex tries to pig out, but you guys thankfully produced<br>
			enough to satisfy his needs. Alex explodes from over-eating.
			<br><br>
			<b>Soviet Communism</b><br>
			You wake up to the glorious anthem of the motherland. You get in your LADA and drive down to the chainsaw factory for your union<br>
			job. You spend the entire day building chainsaws. You get a few food coupons to spend. You go to the local supermarket to redeem them.<br>
			You drink a bottle of vodka.
			<br><br>
			<b>Republican Democracy</b><br>
			You wake up to the sound of Fox News. You look out the window. Your neighbors look more poor than you. You get into your Mercedes<br>
			and move to another neighborhood. You celebrate with beer and more Fox News.
			<br><br>
			<b>Democrat Democracy</b><br>
			You wake up to a pop song about creating social change. Your neighbors look more poor than you. You feel bad and vote a "feel-good"<br>
			politician into office who taxes you more and gives it to your neighbors. You feel smug.
			<br><br>
			<b>Libertarian Democracy</b><br>
			You wake up to the smell of drugs. You grab a blunt and complain about the criminalization of drugs. You look on your computer and see<br>
			that Elon Musk smoked weed. You feel proud.
			<br><br>
			<b>Neckbeard-ism</b><br>
			You wake up to the smell of chicken tenders. You don your fedora and roll off the bed and onto your desk chair. You go on /b/ and start<br>
			complaining about how you can't get a girlfriend. Nothing happens.
			<br><br>
			<b>Anonymous</b><br>
			[REDACTED] wake up and boot up your PC running a custom Linux distro. [REDACTED] see a bunch of [REDACTED] fellow comrades complaining about<br>
			the US government. [REDACTED] all hack into their servers and render the US nuclear arsenal inoperable. Some journalist writes a story about<br>
			the hack. The government somehow patches the server back together.
