<h3>'Murican Capitalism</h3>
You wake up in the morning to the national anthem. You get in your Ford Raptor truck and drive to your<br>
ranch, where you spend the long day wrangling cattle. You get back home and eat a large meal of mashed potatos<br>
and steak. You have a heart attack. You can't afford to go to a hospital and die.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Anarcho-Capitalism</h3>
You wake up to an ad for Wendys™ recreational nuclear warheads. You get in your tank and drive to the<br>
McDonalds™ Megacorp headquarters. You get accused of committing McTreason™ for Carls Jr.™ by stealing McProperty™.<br>
by doing so, you are violating the non-aggression principle. A McNuclear™ McAirstrike™ is deployed on your house.<br>
McDonalds™ McAnnexes™ your land.
<br><br>
<h3>Capitalism</h3>
You wake up in your apartment to screech of your alarm. You drive your falling-apart 1993 Toyota to your dead-end job.<br>
You toil away for hours for little pay. You get home and eat a subpar microwaved dinner. You contemplate your existence.
<br><br>
<h3>Canadian-ism</h3>
You wake up to the refreshing sound of Niagra Falls. You get on your horse and ride to the forest where you gather maple<br>
syrup. Before you can get to Tim Hortons for dinner, you feel a sharp pain in your abdomen. You drive to the hospital and<br>
the doctor orders a CT scan. However, you are placed onto a waitlist. You die from colon cancer after waiting over a year,<br>
never getting your scan.
<br><br>
<h3>European-ism</h>
You wake up to a folk-song, get in your Volkswagen Golf, and drive to work at the local restaraunt. You eat a giant steak.<br>
You get Mad-Cow disease and die. The USA bans beef from your country, and there is universal mass hysteria.<br>
<br><br>
<h3>Marxist Communism</h3>
You wake up to the sound of your comrades toiling away. You walk down to the comune's farm and spend the day harvesting crops<br>
and feeding animals. For dinner, everybody takes as much as they want. However, fat Alex takes way too much and there's no food<br>
left. Everybody agrees to banish Alex.
<br><br>
<h3>Soviet Communism</h3>
You wake up to the glorious anthem of the motherland. You get in your LADA and drive down to the chainsaw factory for your union<br>
job. You spend the entire day building chainsaws. You get a few food coupons to spend. You go to the local breadline to redeem them<br>
but by the time that it's your turn, the bread is rotten. You drink a bottle of vodka.
<br><br>
