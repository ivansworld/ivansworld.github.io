	<h2>Health Anxiety - Ivan</h2>
	<p>If you feel unwell or notice that something isn't quite right with your body, it's best to refrain from googling all<br>
	of your symptoms. I, for one, can speak from personal experience. What was a small, harmless foot twitch ended up becoming<br>
	Parkinsons, then ALS, then MS, and finally a brain tumor. Of course it wasn't any of those things, but that's what kept<br>
	running through my mind. Although each of these ailments are almost unheard of in young adults, how was my otherwise<br>
	rational mind lead to these startling conclusions? Anxiety can manifest itself into many different forms, often effecting<br>
	parts of the body and producing symptoms which mimic those of severe diseases. As has happened to many medical students,<br>
	as you study a frightening disease you can begin to feel mild "symptoms" and from there all rational descision making and<br>
	reasioning goes out the window. You begin to notice little buzzes and twitches and eye floaters which you swear were always<br>
	there, but you can't stop noticing them. If you were seriously ill, it would be much more difficult to perform daily tasks.<br>
	Along with that, statistics prove that you don't have too much to worry about since a good deal of these disorders affect<br>
	more seniors than adolescents. Also, try cutting the doctor shows and medical news if you can. It'll greatly help.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Why I like formal clothing - Ivan</h2>
	<p>Here's a question that I've gotten a few times, "Why do you always wear dress clothes? Isn't it uncomfortable?"<br>
	When it comes to the actual attire, I remember seeing a group of 60s NASA scientists on some documentary as a little<br>
	kid and I instantly thought "Gee, these guys are pretty cool!" Other than that, I can't really pinpoint any other<br>
	specific reason. However, it's also surprisingly comfortable and warm. You eventually get used to it and the more that<br>
	you wear something, the softer that it gets.</p>

	<p>"But the icing on the cake is all the impressionable idiot sheep that jerk off<br> 
	to every word uttered from that retard Napoleon's mouth and that try to fit as many<br> 
	of his dip-shit catch phrases in a single sentance as possible."<br>

	<p>Some types of math are just so weird, I don't know why they exist. Like unless you're going to become a super scientist, and work on <br>
	engines or something like that, we don't need to learn anything past geometry.</p>
