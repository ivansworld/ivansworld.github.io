<h3>Swearing [TechMT]</h3>
Now I want to start this off by saying I swear like a sailor. Even so, I have a problem with it. When someone swears, it doesn't have to <br>
much of an impact. I feel like you can get your point across without swearing, and you don't look like an idiot who constantly swears. On the <br>
contrary, if it i sused in the right circumstances, it can be powerful, and also contribute a lot.
	
<h3>School Is Only As Fun as You Make It [Ivan]</h3>
If you dislike school, why? Do you not like the teachers, your peers, or the actual material? Do you find it to be boring?<br>
Although you may never use your knowledge of angle proofs or synthetic division after graduating, you still gain the very<br>
valuable skill of doing something that you dislike. The point is, you can't avoid school. Why not make the best of it?<br>
As I've observed, your mindset is one of the most important things. Just the act of waking up and forcing yourself to act<br>
excited for school can make you all the bit more motivated and content throughout the day. When you learn about something<br>
that's interesting, don't be afraid to look it up. Enthusiasm is everything. 
<br>
<br>
<h3>Health Anxiety [Ivan]</h3>
If you feel unwell or notice that something isn't quite right with your body, it's best to refrain from searching all<br>
of your symptoms. I, for one, can speak from personal experience. What was a small, harmless f*** twitch ended up becoming<br>
Parkinson's, then ALS, then MS, and finally a brain tumor. Of course it wasn't any of those things, but that's what kept<br>
running through my mind. Although each of these ailments are almost unheard of in young adults, how was my otherwise<br>
rational mind lead to these startling conclusions? Anxiety can manifest itself into many different forms, often effecting<br>
parts of the body and producing symptoms which mimic those of severe diseases. As has happened to many medical students,<br>
as you study a frightening disease you can begin to feel mild "symptoms" and from there all rational decision making and<br>
reasoning goes out the window. You begin to notice little buzzes and twitches and eye floaters which you swear were always<br>
there, but you can't stop looking at them. If you were seriously ill, it would be much more difficult to perform daily tasks.<br>
Along with that, statistics prove that you don't have too much to worry about since a good deal of these disorders affect<br>
more seniors than adolescents. Also, try cutting the doctor shows and medical news if you can. It'll greatly help.

<h3>Why I Enjoy Formal Clothing [Ivan]</h3>
Here's a question that I've gotten a few times, "Why do you always wear dress clothes? Isn't it uncomfortable?"<br>
When it comes to the actual attire, I remember seeing a group of 60s NASA scientists on some documentary as a little<br>
kid and I instantly thought "Gee, these guys are pretty cool!" Other than that, I can't really pinpoint any other<br>
specific reason. However, it's also surprisingly comfortable and warm. You eventually get used to it and the more that<br>
you wear something, the softer that it gets.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Just Some Random Thoughts [TechMT]</h3>
Some types of math are just so weird, I don't know why they exist. Like unless you're going to become a super<br>
scientist, and work on engines or something like that, we don't need to learn anything past geometry.
