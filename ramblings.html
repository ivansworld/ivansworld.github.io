			<b>Careers - 1/27/2020 [Ivan]</b><br>
			Although I still have a bit of time, I can't help but feel anxious about choosing a future career. For most of my life, I wanted to go<br>
			into computer science. In middle school, I started to become interested in business. Now I'm a sophomore in High School whose trying to<br>
			choose between aspiring to get a CS degree or to go to medschool and become a neurologist. I surely have the grades for both, but I can<br>
			really only choose one (college costs money). 
			<br><br>
			<b>AP Torture - 11/22/2019 [Ivan]</b><br>
			It's a shame that these days, school is more about doing well on tests and getting degrees than actually learning the material. As a<br>
			sophomore, I've had to endure two AP classes and while I know that I need them for college, I can't help but feel that I've not learnt<br>
			much. The strong focus of the class is cramming enough info in to your head so you can dump it into the AP test, get a 5, and forget it all,<br>
			and that's really a shame. And in all honesty, the class material really isn't that hard, or wouldn't be if the teacher actually taught us.<br>
			The hardest parts are the insane amount of homework (which the teacher only collects at random) and the teacher's asinine grading scale.<br>
			Sure, I'm doing well in the class but if APs weren't so essential to get into college, then I'd rather just take their honors counterparts.
			<br><br>
			<b>Summer - 8/18/2019 [Ivan]</b><br>
			Whelp, summer vacation is almost over and... I spent the entire time playing video games and watching videos. Fun.
			<br><br>
			<b>A word about intelligence - 4/8/2019 [Ivan]</b><br>
			I once read something pretty good online a while ago. I don't remember who wrote it, but I still have a screenshot. It reads:<br>
			"Intelligence doesn't mean you are right all the time, and you have perfected everything. It doesn't mean you know all the words<br>
			and spellings and grammar. Intelligence is about awareness. Your level of awareness (and not knowledge) defines you level of intelligence."
			<br><br>
			<b>The Internet of Things - 3/1/2019 [Ivan]</b><br>
			<img src="Files/Comics/comic1.png" alt="board" align="left">
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			<b>Swearing [TechMT]</b><br>
			Now I want to start this off by saying I swear like a sailor. Even so, I have a problem with it. When someone swears, it doesn't have to <br>
			much of an impact. I feel like you can get your point across without swearing, and you don't look like an idiot who constantly swears. On the <br>
			contrary, if it is used in the right circumstances, it can be powerful, and also contribute a lot.
				<br><br>
			<b>School Is Only As Fun as You Make It [Ivan]</b><br>
			If you dislike school, why? Do you not like the teachers, your peers, or the actual material? Do you find it to be boring?<br>
			Although you may never use your knowledge of angle proofs or synthetic division after graduating, you still gain the very<br>
			valuable skill of doing something that you dislike. The point is, you can't avoid school. Why not make the best of it?<br>
			As I've observed, your mindset is one of the most important things. Just the act of waking up and forcing yourself to act<br>
			excited for school can make you all the bit more motivated and content throughout the day. When you learn about something<br>
			that's interesting, don't be afraid to look it up. Enthusiasm is everything. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Health Anxiety [Ivan]</b><br>
			If you feel unwell or notice that something isn't quite right with your body, it's best to refrain from searching all<br>
			of your symptoms. I, for one, can speak from personal experience. What was a small, harmless foot twitch ended up becoming<br>
			Parkinson's, then ALS, then MS, and finally a brain tumor. Of course it wasn't any of those things, but that's what kept<br>
			running through my mind. Although each of these ailments are almost unheard of in young adults, how was my otherwise<br>
			rational mind lead to these startling conclusions? Anxiety can manifest itself into many different forms, often effecting<br>
			parts of the body and producing symptoms which mimic those of severe diseases. As has happened to many medical students,<br>
			as you study a frightening disease you can begin to feel mild "symptoms" and from there all rational decision making and<br>
			reasoning goes out the window. You begin to notice little buzzes and twitches and eye floaters which you swear were always<br>
			there, but you can't stop looking at them. If you were seriously ill, it would be much more difficult to perform daily tasks.<br>
			Along with that, statistics prove that you don't have too much to worry about since a good deal of these disorders affect<br>
			more seniors than adolescents. Also, try cutting the doctor shows and medical news if you can. It'll greatly help.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Just Some Random Thoughts [TechMT]</b><br>
			Some types of math are just so weird, I don't know why they exist. Like unless you're going to become a super<br>
			scientist, and work on engines or something like that, we don't need to learn anything past geometry.
